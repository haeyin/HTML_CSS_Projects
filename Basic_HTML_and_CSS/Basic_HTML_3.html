    <h1>The Movie that Never Was</h1>
    <p>Avatar the Last Airbender was never made into a movie. It never happened. Period.</p>
    <h1>I hope Sonic makes it.</h1>
    <p>After all that fuss, I hope Sonic doesn't suffer the same fate. It was very close, but there's still hope.</p>
    <h3>I have high hopes for the Avatar TLA movie that Netflix makes!</h3>
